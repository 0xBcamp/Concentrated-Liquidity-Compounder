# Concentrated-Liquidity-Compounder

The goal of this project will be to encourage familiarity with UniV3 and associated tradeoffs, and to create ease-of-use tooling to support Ramses cross-chain systems.

Study Bunni, GMD, and Arrakis to gain a firm understanding of how teams are implementing concentrated liquidity management solutions and design a custom solution for Reaper. Additionally, study Ramses architecture and reward mechanisms and tailor your first implementation to their system.
